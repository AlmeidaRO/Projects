<h1>Crab Species Prediction</h1>
Welcome to the Crab Species Prediction repository! This training project aims to predict crab species using supervised machine learning techniques. In this example, we can observe the crab biology and develop prediction models to classification and deploy the models.

<br>

<h2>Problem Description</h2>
Crabs are crustacean, belong to Brachyura order. There are different types of crabs, totaling over 850 species. Most varieties of crab have 3 walking legs on either side of their body, 2 pinching claws and hard outer shell. Some species can be very similar, been a hard task to performe the crab species classification.

<h2>Project Objective</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Develop a robust supervised machine learning modelsto predict crab species based on biological features measurements.
    </li>
    <li>
        Develop a graphical interface (dashboard) to deploy any model created.
    </li>
</ul>
